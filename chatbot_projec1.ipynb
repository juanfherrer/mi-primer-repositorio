For example, you could assign higher weights to more severe symptoms or create rules to identify specific combinations of symptoms that indicate particular conditions.\n",
        "Contextual awareness: Enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and utilize the context of the conversation to provide more relevant responses.\n",

        "Error handling: Improve the chatbot's robustness by adding more comprehensive error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid input or missing data.\n",
        "External knowledge bases: Explore integrating more extensive medical knowledge bases or ontologies to provide a wider range of diagnoses and more detailed information.\n",
